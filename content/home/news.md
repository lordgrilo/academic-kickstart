## **Recent**

*9.5.20* FINALLY managed to find the time to fix the permissions on the website, I'm back! 

*15.7.19* I wrote an [editorial](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/netn_e_00096) to cap the [Focus Feature on Topological Neuroscience](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/netn/3/3) in the journal Network Neuroscience. Go have a look, there are quite a few interesting contributions!

*21.5.19* I visited the [brain Dynamics Lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/bdl/index.html) at Stanford to work with these great folks and give a short crash course on TDA. 

*17.5.19* I was very happy to teach at [Lake Como Complex Networks School](http://ntme.lakecomoschool.org). Slides available here (lecture [1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1vy3k0840q60fvb/Lezione-1.pdf?dl=0) and [2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p8ktrvg8j3iretv/Lezione-2.pdf?dl=0)). 


## **Past**

*22.4.19* - WoW! The Royal Society Publishing blog has posted a [Q&A interview](https://t.co/G0nkSDnVZv) on our 2014 ["homological scaffold"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2014.0873) paper in Interface!  

*20.4.19* - "Spectral and topological analyses of the cortical representation of the head position: Does hypnotizability matter?" is now published on Brain&Behaviour. You can find it online [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brb3.1277). 

*12.3.19* - I had the pleasure to talk about complexity and brain connectivity in front of broad audience at [Circolo dei Lettori](https://www.circololettori.it/) in the context of the [Brain Awareness Week 2019](https://www.settimanadelcervello.it/). Slides are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nmruigbh6shei84/baw-torino-2019.pdf?dl=0) (without videos though).

*6.3.19* - I am giving a talk at [IGC Lisbon](http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/) on the relevance of TDA for biological sciences! Slides will be posted [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/31c7hqndkou5hi5/IGC-slides.pdf?dl=0).

*25.2.19* - Our paper on spectral and topological features of EEG during head rotation was accepted on Brain&Behaviour! Preprint available on Bioarxiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/442053v1). 

*22.2.19* - My paper with [Sam Scarpino](http://scarpino.github.io) on the predictability of epidemic outbreak is published on Nature Communications. Check it out [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08616-0)!.

*20.2.19* - New website updated, finally! 

*26.01.19* - I gave a crash course on Topological Data Analysis at the [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://www.appliedmldays.org/) in Lausanne. Slides and notebooks are available [here](https://github.com/lordgrilo/AML-days-TDA-tutorial).

<!-- *29.11.18* - The paper on the Simplicial Activity Driven model with A. Barrat is now published in PRL, check it out [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.228301).  -->
